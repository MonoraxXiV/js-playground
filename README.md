# js-playground

This project is a way of revisiting previously learned programming languages as a way of practice.

These languages will be javascript, css and html. The goal of this exercise is to make a full website with a good and hopefully responsive design.

On top of that I hope to push my skills further than before by adding interesting and previously unknown components.
